# TSRegressionToolkit
An all-in-one toolkit for time-series regression analysis in Python. Perform regression tests, visualize relationships, and gain deeper insights into your time-dependent data with ease.
# TimeSeriesRegressor
The TimeSeriesRegressor is a Python library for time-series regression analysis and forecasting. It provides comprehensive statistical tests and visualizations to help you unlock insights and uncover patterns in your time-dependent data.

# Features
 1. Perform multiple variable time-series regression analysis
 2. Conduct statistical tests for assessing relationships and causality between variables
 3. Generate visualizations such as line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to aid in data analysis
 4. Handle CSV file uploads and process data for regression analysis
 5. Support for dashboards and interactive data visualization using Dash and Plotly
# Installation
  To use the TimeSeriesRegressor library, you need to have Python 3.x installed. You can install the library and its dependencies using pip:
    
    pip install timeseriesregressor

# Usage
  Import the necessary modules:

    import timeseriesregressor as tsr
    import pandas as pd
  Read the data from a CSV file:
    
    data = pd.read_csv('New_data.csv')
  Perform time-series regression analysis:
    
    regressor = tsr.TimeSeriesRegressor()
    regressor.fit(data, target_column='target', feature_columns=['feature1', 'feature2'])
  Visualize the results:
    
    regressor.plot_results()
  Interpret the statistical tests:
     
     regressor.run_tests()
For more detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the documentation.
